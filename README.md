# **Gait cycle analysis**

Hi everyone!
I'm Lola Carcereny, a Biomedical Engineering student at University Pompeu Fabra.

The project presented in the following lines was developed some months ago as a Biomechanics study for the University. Please feel free to explore each subpage in my wiki for a detailed understanding of the project. 


In order to identify the causes of anomalies in our locomotor system and the way we walk, a gait study is usually conducted. The reason of this analysis is due to the fact that most of these pathologies are not caused by traumas but by the induviduals way of walking. This study consists on exploring, through advannced technologies, the beahaviours and positions of our joints and feet in both dynamic and static dynamics.

When walking, unlike running, one of the two feet is always in contact with the ground, which is why the gait cycle is divided into two phases. The first phase is the stance phace, which begins once the foot makes contact with the ground and ends when it lifts off. In other words, as long as the reference foot is in contact with the ground, we will be in the support phase. This phase usually lasts about 60% of the total gait cycle time. In the second phase, the swing phase, the reference foot is not in contact with the ground but moves through the air. This phase lasts approximately the remaining 40% of the gait cycle time [1]. 

The aim of this work is to calculate the reaction forces, moments and powers exerted by the joints during both phases of walking through theoretical calculations and, lately, compare them with the values obtained by the program. This will help us determine the accuracy of the software.
